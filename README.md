# Underwater-Species-Detection-and-Web-Exploration

The project **Underwater Species Detection and Web Exploration: Enhancing Video Quality for Marine Life Recognition** aims to revolutionize the way marine life is studied and monitored by leveraging cutting-edge machine learning models and web technologies. At the core of the project, advanced species detection models such as **YOLOv5 and YOLOv8** have been implemented to accurately identify and classify underwater species from video footage.

To complement the detection system, a video quality enhancement module has been integrated, employing techniques like noise reduction, color correction, and resolution upscaling. Enhanced video quality ensures that the species detection models receive the best possible input, thereby increasing the accuracy of the recognition process.

Additionally, the project features a user-friendly web interface developed using the **Flask framework**, enabling users to upload their underwater videos and view the detection results seamlessly. The interface not only displays the identified species but also incorporates a web crawling component that fetches additional information about these species.
